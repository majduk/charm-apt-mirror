  description: |
    Pull the .deb packages from the upstream based on the config "mirror-list",
    and synchronize the package metadata (index files) with the upstream. In
    addition, unreferenced packages will be automatically cleaned up without
    confirmation; also see check-packages and clean-up-packages actions.

    source:
      description: |
        Run synchronize for a specific mirror. This parameter is used as a regular
        expression to filter the list of mirrors provided by the "mirror-list"
        configuration option. Leave unset to synchronize all mirrors.
        The following example synchronizes all mirrors starting with
        "deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/".
